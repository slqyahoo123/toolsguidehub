## 🔍 Understanding the Cost Per Million Tokens

AI pricing is typically measured per 1 million tokens. However, the ratio between **Input tokens** (your prompt) and **Output tokens** (the AI's response) is what determines the final cost.

### GPT-4o Pricing Structure
OpenAI has optimized GPT-4o for speed and efficiency. As of 2026, its pricing remains competitive, especially for high-throughput applications requiring low latency.

### Claude 3.5 Sonnet Pricing Structure
Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet is often praised for its "intelligence-to-price" ratio. It provides near-Opus level performance at a Sonnet price point, making it a favorite for coding and complex data extraction.

## 🛠️ How to Estimate Your Monthly AI Budget

Estimating costs manually is prone to error. To get an accurate budget, follow these steps:

1.  **Estimate Input/Output Ratio:** For chatbots, the ratio is usually 1:2. For data extraction, it might be 10:1.
2.  **Calculate Daily Volume:** How many requests do you expect per day?
3.  **Factor in Context Caching:** Anthropic offers significant discounts for cached prompts—a feature you should definitely leverage for repetitive tasks.

> **💡 Pro Tip:** You can toggle between different models and instantly see the yearly cost impact using our [Interactive Pricing Tool](/tools/ai-token-cost-calculator).
