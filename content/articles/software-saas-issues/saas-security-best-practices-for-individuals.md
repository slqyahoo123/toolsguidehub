## 🔒 Your Data is the Target

As we use more cloud-based software in 2026, the surface area for potential security risks has expanded. A single compromised AI account or project management login can give a hacker access to your financial data, professional secrets, and private conversations.

Securing your SaaS stack is no longer optional—it's a fundamental digital hygiene requirement.

## 🔑 1. The Passkey Revolution

In 2026, traditional passwords are considered "Legacy Tech."
- **Passkeys:** If a SaaS tool supports Passkeys (using FaceID, TouchID, or a physical security key), **use it**. Passkeys are immune to phishing because they never leave your device.
- **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication):** For tools that don't support Passkeys yet, always use an authenticator app (like Authy or Google Authenticator) rather than SMS-based codes.

## 🕵️ 2. Audit "OAuth" Permissions Regularly

Have you ever "Logged in with Google" or "Logged in with GitHub" to try a quick demo tool? You may have granted that tool permission to read your emails or browse your private repositories.

**Security Drill:** 
1. Go to your Google/GitHub/Microsoft account settings.
2. Find the "Connected Apps" or "Third-Party Access" section.
3. Remove any app you haven't used in the last 30 days.

## 🤖 3. AI Data Privacy Settings

When using tools like ChatGPT or Claude, remember that **by default**, your data may be used to train future versions of the model.
- **Privacy Mode:** Most AI platforms now have an "Invisible" or "Opt-out" mode. 
- **The Golden Rule:** Never paste sensitive company data, passwords, or private financial records into a standard LLM prompt unless you are using an Enterprise-grade subscription with a guaranteed Data Processing Agreement (DPA).

## 📉 4. Managing Offboarding

The most common security leak occurs when a user stops paying for a tool but leaves their account (and their data) active.
- **Full Deletion:** When you cancel a subscription, don't just "downgrade to free." Request a full account deletion if you no longer need the data.

> **💡 Tool Tip:** Not sure which tools are worth keeping for the long term? Use our [SaaS ROI Calculator](/tools/saas-roi-calculator) to evaluate your current software stack and decide which ones to keep and which ones to secure and delete.
