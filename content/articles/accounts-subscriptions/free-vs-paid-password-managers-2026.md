## 🤔 Free vs. Paid: Is It Worth It?

If you are a solo user with standard security needs, **Bitwarden Free is more than enough**. It gives you the core experience without a subscription.

However, if you manage accounts for a family, a small team, or you handle sensitive client data, the paid tier of **1Password** provides peace of mind that is hard to quantify.

> **💡 Tool Tip:** Unsure if the subscription is justified? Calculate the actual value using our [SaaS ROI Calculator](/tools/saas-roi-calculator). Factor in the "time saved" from not resetting forgotten passwords (average: 12 minutes per reset × 5 resets per year).

---

## 🏁 Our Recommendation

1. **Start with Bitwarden Free.** Import your saved Chrome/Safari passwords.
2. **After 30 days,** evaluate if you need breach alerts or sharing features.
3. **If yes,** upgrade to 1Password for the best UI/UX and security audit tools.
